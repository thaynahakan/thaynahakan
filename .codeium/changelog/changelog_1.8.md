# What's New with **Codeium v1.8 🚀**

## Chat Redesigns 🎨

Codeium's chat panel has a major upgrade! All of Codeium Chat's functionality, featuring new and improved design and readability, can now be found in the 'Chat' tab. We also added a new Profile and Context (see below) tab to enable more Codeium powers. If you have any feedback, please follow the link at the bottom of the Profile tab.

## Context Pinning 📍

Context Pinning is a prototype feature that allows you to specify and persist relevant information within Codeium's context awareness engine. Through this panel, you can now do things like **pinning an subdirectory or even an external library** so Codeium knows to use its content to improve the quality of Codeium's autocomplete, command, and chat. Try it out today and learn more about it in our [blog post](https://codeium.com/blog/codeium-context-pinning-launch).

## Series B 💰

In company news, we announced our [$65m Series B round](https://codeium.com/blog/series-b-annoucement) round at the end of January. While we were not in need of cash, we do believe it will allow us to accelerate development of our differentiated technical capabilities. We've historically been leading in the productionization of new features, such as context aware in-IDE chat, and this **will ensure we can keep shipping the best product to you!** It's also a strong vote of confidence from some preeminent VC firms (who keep very close tabs on all progress in this space) that we are a leader in this new, fast-moving industry. Besides being one of the most used products, we are now also one of the best-funded companies in the gen-AI-for-software-development space and that's really exciting for the future of the company. 🎉
